# Fashion Costume Identification using Machine Learning in R

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques in R to identify different types of fashion costumes. The analysis is conducted using the Fashion MNIST dataset provided by Zalando Research, available at [https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop and implement machine learning models capable of accurately classifying and identifying various types of fashion costumes present in the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Methods Used

- Machine learning classification algorithms
- R programming language

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is Fashion MNIST, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories. It serves as a benchmark for image classification tasks and is available at [https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
